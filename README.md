# don

I was interested by mastodon, but found it to be a little too heavyweight for
me. I want something I can run as a single binary with no other services. To
that end, I'm embarking on writing this - tentatively named don.

I'm not sure what it'll end up being. Right now it's just an experiment in
plugging different protocols together. Maybe it'll be a full node
implementation, but maybe not.
