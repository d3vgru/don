# don

I was interested by mastodon, but found it to be a little too heavyweight for
me. I want something I can run as a single binary with no other services. To
that end, I'm embarking on writing this - tentatively named don.

i'm not sure what it'll end up being. right now it's ~~just an experiment in
plugging different protocols together~~ a rudimentary read-only client. maybe
it'll be a full node implementation, but maybe not.
